It is always hard to focus on what it is really important. Life throws at you so many things during a normal day that it is no wonder our brain is used to reverting to automatic pilot most of the time.

Fortunately (or not), I am in a position to take control of my life and work in something I am passionate about. Now how many people get to say that everyday? 

I will use this space to craft my Master's Thesis and at the same time try to launch a business at the end of it with everything I learn. After all I have to make a living somehow with a Masters degree. 

## Follow me in this great adventure.
