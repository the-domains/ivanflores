  Ever since I proposed myself to become a better person it has gotten tougher
  and tougher to publish a post. In Facebook, in Medium, Twitter, every social
  media platform seems infected by social peer-pressure of being the best at
  what you do. The best at sports, traveling and at looking professional.
  Companies are supposedly stalking you, watching your pictures, waiting for you
  to get fucked up with your friends and end up in an embarrassing situation by
  more drunk people. That never happens to you right?

Ever since I proposed myself to become a better person it has gotten tougher and tougher to publish a post. In Facebook, in Medium, Twitter, every social media platform seems infected by social peer-pressure of being the best at what you do. The best at sports, traveling and at looking professional. Companies are supposedly stalking you, watching your pictures, waiting for you to get fucked up with your friends and end up in an embarrassing situation by more drunk people. That never happens to you right?

I am tired of being fearful, and checking myself every time I will say something that is not politically correct. But, I guess it is ultimately a good thing for everyone. In order to appear like we are actually progressing we have to "appear" in that state, fake it 'till you make it mentality. I know, you have to pay the bills, and the only way is to sign up for a corporation doing the highest minimum-wage bidding for you time. You will spend 80% of your waking life, going to runned-down shitty places that look like no one in their sane mind would go in UNLESS you happen to work there. 

People are shitty man, they come in all shapes and sizes. I'm included. We have to shift our thought-process forward, towards a place where everyone would want to live. Envision that place like it is going to be our next vacation destination and in this particular case, you have to wait 25 years --- at least. Then put on our working pants and grind out our way there. 

There is so much to look forward to, outer -planets exploration, new dimensions in the space/time fabric and any crazy shit you can ever imagine! It's all happening, trust me. 

Until then, doubts will be a common thread in your personal journal. Overcome them, be relentless.
